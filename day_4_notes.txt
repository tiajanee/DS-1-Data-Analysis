Given population mean and standard deviation, calculate sample size mean of specific population?

normal distribution = bell curve

cumulative probablity (a range of values before or after a point) v. point probability (frequency calculation of some specific value)

AUC of one point - AUC of another point = gives you a specific range

z score = (x - x-bar) / standard deviation

relationship b/w z score and probablity: they are the same? can use one to find the other.


good sample size = 30

distribution is affected heavily by both sample size and range of data points

continuous (a variety of data points) v. discrete data (binary outcome)
